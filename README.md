# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
V.Isualize wanted me to use my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type. Following this, I was tasked to use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This report and data visualization will help Pyber to easily read how the data differs and what kind of actions PyBer can take to maximize their topline. 

## Results: 

The image below captures the weekly fares generated across the three different city types Urban, Suburban and Rural regions.

## Summary: 
Based on this readable and actionable data analysis and visualization, I have the following recommendations for PyBer.
1) Rural region is an underserved region with few driver counts and higher fare$/ride. Pyber could benefit by expanding further into this high-fare region.
2) Pyber can entire customers with coupons and discounts during the dips as seen in the weekly chart, to reduce the effect of seasonality on their revenues.
3) Pyber can incentivize suburban and rural drivers more than urban drivers to increase business in those regions.
